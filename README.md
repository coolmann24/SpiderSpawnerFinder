Cave Spider Spawner Cluster Finder

A lot of people were asking for the source and I've been too lazy to finish and polish this up, so I decided to to release it.

Notes: 

-This implementation is pretty hacky and basically just rips some files directly from decompiled MCP code, so this may be sketchy to put up (not like I'm making money though) but oh well.

-The search is pretty unoptimized unlike the Blaze Finder.

-I'm pretty sure the spawner Y level is screwed up.

-It's actually much harder to get the exact location a cave spider spawner is placed, so in this finder I basically just use the location of the structure piece that has a spawner. This finder may tell you that you have an in range cluster but some spawners are actually out of range.

-Use at your own discretion.
