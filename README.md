Cave Spider Spawner Cluster Finder

A lot of people were asking for the source and I've been too lazy to finish and polish this up, so I decided to to release it.

Notes: 

-This implementation is pretty hacky and basically just rips some files directly from decompiled MCP code, so this may be sketchy to put up (not like I'm making money though) but oh well.

-The search is pretty unoptimized unlike the Blaze Finder.

-Use at your own discretion.
